Bristow Holland had some kind words:

> We were delighted to be involved NorDevCon 2015 as a sponsor, the format was excellent with a range of topics and subject matter for everyone, we particularly enjoyed the business track which offered really accessible insight into the business tech community. We met some great contacts and learnt a lot, including several enquiries from prospective customers which we are busy following up on, the facilities were excellent and the food and drink were great too â€“ all in all a fantastic effort from the Naked Element team, roll on 2016!
